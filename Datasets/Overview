To complete our project, we utilized a dataset that was put together in a study. (Link: https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201859#Sec19). This data
centered around lakes in New York, USA. It contained multiple measures, including physical characteristics. However, we were concerned with the chemical and 
nutrient aspects of the water.
